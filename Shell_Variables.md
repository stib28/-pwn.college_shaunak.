# 1.PRINTING VARIABLES 
print a variable to the shell to get flag.

## MY SOLVE 
**FLAG:** `pwn.college{crwvA9tQ_I_QbKNJUfkFTkv62qB.QX3UTN0wSNxkjNzEzW}`
```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{crwvA9tQ_I_QbKNJUfkFTkv62qB.QX3UTN0wSNxkjNzEzW}
```
simply read the instructions and print the variable by using echo command and inserting a `$` before the variable name, where `$` just marks the current working directory.

## WHAT I LEARNED 
printing a variable using `echo` command.

## REFERENCES 
none.
